/*
note this condition is not true if we maxi rob1 and will get rob2 max in remiming(its not correct approch,let see why)
bcoz Letâ€™s take this example, 
if grid =
[[2, 4, 6],
[8, 9, 10]], 

the first robot could take the path 2 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 to maximize its points, leaving 4 and 6 for the second robot. 

But the better strategy is for the first robot to turn down at index 1, leaving either 6 or 8 for the second robot, which would then get max(6, 8) = 8 points instead of 10.

You can clearly see that here the point of Robot2 is prioritised instead of maximising the points of Robot1
so-->
## correct approch is that "rob1 should slelect such path so that robb2 will et minimum "   */
